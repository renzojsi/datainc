<div style="max-width: 50%;"/>
<p> Plot 3 above shows the probabilities for positive/negative news headlines per stock, for all US stocks.  The data is only for 1 day of news headlines obtained from Yahoo Finance RSS feeds.  Each stock has between 0-20 news headlines.  The real project would contain many more news headlines per stock.  The data set is approx. 46MB for 1 day worth of headlines.  These probabilities will change over time.
